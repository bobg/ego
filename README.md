# Ego - an embedded Go interpreter

This is Ego, an embedded Go interpreter.
I started it a few years ago,
set it aside unfinished,
then never returned to it
after seeing that others had already written versions of the same thing
([yaegi](https://github.com/traefik/yaegi), [tengo](https://github.com/d5/tengo)).

Getting as far as I did gave me a much better understanding of Go internals than I had had to that point.
